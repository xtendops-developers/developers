As a software developer under XtendOps, Iâ€™m expected to abide the following:
- never create or distribute malware.
- never write code that is obfuscated or intentionally difficult to follow.
- never write documentation that is intentionally confusing or inaccurate.
- never reuse copyrighted code unless the proper license is purchased or permission is
obtained.
- acknowledge (verbally and in source code comments) the work of other programmers on
which the code is based, even if substantial changes are made.
- never write code that is deliberately inefficient with the intent of later claiming credit for
making efficiency improvements.
- never intentionally introduce bugs with the intent of later claiming credit for fixing the
bugs, or to stimulate the uptake of later versions.
- never write code that intentionally breaks another programmer&#39;s code for the purpose of
elevating one&#39;s status.
- never hide known obstacles to a project&#39;s completion during any phase of development,
especially the design phase.
- never dishonestly downplay the difficulty of completing a project.
- report any illegal activities of the employer.
- never defame the profession.
- never falsely deny the presence of bugs.
- never reveal the secret corporate knowledge of an employer.
- never accept compensation from multiple parties for the same work unless permission is
given.
- never perform competitive work without the employer&#39;s knowledge.
- never conceal pertinent information from other members of the development team.
- never conceal from the employer their financial interest in development resources.
- never conceal any conflict of interest that may affect the project.
- never seek external profit from a project that was funded by a second party without
permission. If permission is given to resell a product, the work should be discounted.
- never maliciously injure the reputation of an employer or members of the development
team.
- never misrepresent their knowledge, experience, or abilities.
- never take credit for another&#39;s work.
- never steal software, especially development tools.
- never conceal the deficiencies of other programmers by writing code for them and
allowing them to pass it off as their own work.
- install third-party applications without the user&#39;s permission. Preferably not at all.
- stay current on the advancement of the field of Computer Science.
- never force updates on a user without their knowledge and approval.
