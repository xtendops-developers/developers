## Conclusion

$59-599 price tag doesn’t justify what it gives. It is basically material-ui with only customized color + other libraries. Even if it gives us a headstart, the version we have is far more superior and gives us more leg room as this was written by us from scratch. I’m sorry as the pacing is slow as we have to deal with configurations first. This is my first time utilizing material-ui as well so I have to familiarize myself to get me going. Right now, I’m confident as I’ve finished the needed configurations; added demos for the team; and finalized the layout.

I have trust with the team that we could deliver this(They actually have progress but failed to integrate it on the routes). It might not be appreciated right now but it’ll soon have snowball effect once everything is laid out. For now, you could check out the progress here: http://careers.xtendops.com/

I’m one slack-chat away. Cheers!
